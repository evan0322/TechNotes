# ML with Python

Machine learning is a method that  automates analyticle model building



### Three types of Machine Learning algorithm

##### Supervised Learning

You have labeled data and trying to predict  label based off known features.

Commonly used in applications where historical data predicts likely future events

##### Unsupervised Learning

You have unlabeled data and trying to group together similar data points based off features.

self-organizing maps, nearest-neighbour mapping, k-means clustering and singular vs value decomposition. 

##### Reinforcement Learning

 Algorithm learns to perform an action from experience

Consisted with tree parts:

* Agent: the learner
* Environment: everything the agent interact with
* Action: What the agent can do

The object is for the agent to choose actions that maximize the expected reward over a given amount of time.
